INTRODUCTION
------------
 
 Provides a quick method to create a tour for the /node/add/{content_type} page.

   
INSTRUCTIONS
------------

1. Visit the Manage Tour tab for a content-type: /admin/structure/types/manage/{content_type}/tour.

2. Select the fields that should be included on the tour.

3. Enable tour.

4. You will be redirected to the tour UI (/admin/config/user-interface/tour/manage/{tour-id})where you can view the 
content-type tour you just generated. Tips have been generated with the correct data-id and the tip body field has been 
populated with the field helper text if it is present. On this tour UI you can further edit, add, and modify the tour 
tips. See the tour_ui module documentation for more information.

5. To auto-generate more tips based on content-type fields return to the Manage Tour tab and select additional fields. 
Tour tips can only be deleted through the tour UI. 

6. To disable a tour for a content type simply uncheck the enable tour checkbox on the Manage Tour UI.
